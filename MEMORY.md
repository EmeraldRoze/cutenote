2026-04-22 — PDF download feature on admin dashboard — generates printable 6x4 postcard (front: card design, back: note text + address)
2026-04-23/24 — (recovered from git history; MEMORY.md was not updated at the time) Birthday field at signup, Sign in with Google, trust proxy fix, compose-without-subscription, connection approval flow + private profiles, remove connection button, privacy toggle, home page redesign, email-exact-match user search
2026-05-04 — (recovered from git history) Writing prompts + invite flow, 3-at-a-time prompt refresh, AI Help tab removed (Blank + Starters only), profile page with Quties list, tone selector removed
2026-10-06 — iOS app work started. API base URL made configurable (VITE_API_BASE), capacitor://localhost added to API CORS allowlist
2026-10-06 — Capacitor installed in apps/web (appId club.cutenote.app, appName QuteNote), iOS project generated, web build synced, app builds and runs in iPhone 18 Pro simulator showing the landing page
2026-10-06 — App-mode polish: native app skips landing page straight to /login (isNativeApp in lib/native.ts), safe-area padding via .native-app class + viewport-fit=cover, capacitor backgroundColor cream + contentInset never (automatic caused white strip), landing nav hides section links under 640px. Verified in simulator
2026-10-06 — Sign in with Apple: appleId column in schema (NOT yet on live DB), POST /auth/apple verifies Apple identity token via jose JWKS (aud club.cutenote.app), apple-sign-in plugin + black buttons on Login/SignUp (native only), App.entitlements + CODE_SIGN_ENTITLEMENTS wired
2026-10-06 — Google in-app fix: /auth/google?native=1 sets state=native, callback redirects to qutenote://auth/success?token=; app opens Google in system browser (@capacitor/browser), appUrlOpen listener in AuthContext catches the token; qutenote:// scheme registered in Info.plist. Buttons render verified in simulator
2026-10-06 — FIREFLY bundle executed: live DB updated via prisma db execute (appleId column + Invite tables which were MISSING since May — invite feature was broken in prod), code deployed to DO (ACTIVE, /auth/apple verified live), Emerald's stamp icon + cream splash installed
2026-10-06 — Apple paperwork via ASC API: bundle ID club.cutenote.app registered (58AWMG6XQZ), Sign in with Apple capability enabled (PRIMARY_APP_CONSENT), provisioning profile "QuteNote AppStore" created + installed (cert NVA7KZQ4G5), app record created via browser (Emerald signed in) — App ID 6819877820, SKU qutenote-001
2026-10-06 — Build 1.0(1) archived unsigned, exported with manual signing exportOptions + ASC key flags, UPLOADED to App Store Connect. ITSAppUsesNonExemptEncryption=false in Info.plist. Watcher (scratchpad qutenote_testflight.js) polls processing → copies beta review contact from Dreambound → sets test notes → creates Public Beta group w/ public link → submits beta review

2026-10-08 — Domain consolidation (FIREFLY): Stripe webhook -> qutenote.com, GitHub repo renamed EmeraldRoze/qutenote (DO spec updated, deploy verified), cutenote.club 301-redirects to qutenote.com via Cloudflare rule. Folder renamed ~/Documents/QUTENOTEDEV
2026-10-08 — Brand kit applied from Emerald's qutenote-web-assets.zip: watercolor wordmark (public/brand/logo.png) on Login/SignUp/Home, 20 torn-paper emoji (public/emoji/) via QEmoji component across occasions, review step, card picker, badges, celebration pages, landing Join button. Build 4 uploaded with it all

2026-10-08/09 — Landing page restyled to watercolor brand (cream paper, plum Recoleta, white nav with wordmark, plum footer), then Emerald's full website copy applied verbatim + fonts unified to app set (Recoleta/DM Sans/Caveat; Lobster and Lora removed). Verified in local preview, deployed, confirmed live
2026-10-09 — Google sign-in in-app fix: callback for native now serves a "You're signed in / Open QuteNote" page with tap-to-return button instead of silent qutenote:// redirect (iOS blocks silent custom-scheme redirects). Server-side only, no new build needed. Awaiting Emerald retest

2026-10-09 — Font watermark fix (trial Recoleta renders fi/fl as Latinotype watermark boxes — ligatures disabled globally; OPEN: license real Recoleta or swap before public launch). Build 5 approved with it
2026-10-09 — Round edits from Emerald: handwriting font is Rock Salt everywhere (--font-handwriting + landing, sizes tuned down since Rock Salt runs wide; postcard PRODUCT fonts untouched), Free Profile card copy updated, FAQ title back to "Good questions.", full website copy + fonts from her doc applied. All live on qutenote.com

2026-10-09 — NEW DESIGN SYSTEM applied from "QuteNote iOS Design Guide.docx" (Downloads): Ultraviolet #5A32D6 sole action color, Unbounded headlines (never bold), Anonymous Pro body/buttons (caps + tracking), ruled cream paper, lavenders #A78BC7/#D9C9F1/#EEE6FA, stone, lime #C6FF3D (countdowns/new dots only), ALL pinks retired, Recoleta+Rock Salt+DM Sans retired (trial-font licensing issue dissolved). Implemented via index.css token aliases (old var names map to new values) + landing :root retokenized. Quties -> QTs renamed. Price stays $7.95 (guide settle-item; Stripe reality). Favicon served as /favicon-v4.png (CDN cache workaround — CF token can't purge). Build 6 uploaded
2026-10-09 — NOT YET BUILT from the guide (future rounds): status rows/popup, lime countdown nudge cards, stamp book, handwriting capture, group cards, 5-tab bar with + button, onboarding flow, 2-hour edit window, occasion-in-prompt-dropdown

2026-10-09 — HOME + SEND FLOW REBUILT from Emerald's board (design/redesign-oct-2026, incl. exported HTML with exact styles): new HomePage (Happenings status row + composer sheet, time-of-day Unbounded greeting, lime countdown nudge card from important-dates, merged statuses+sends feed with hearts and new-dots, empty states), TabBar component (Home/QTs/SEND-stamp/Dates/Profile), 4-step send flow (Choose a card w/ TO row + recipient sheet, Write w/ occasion-in-prompts dropdown + pen row, Ready to send postcard preview, It's on its way). Backend: Status + Heart models, /statuses routes (POST, mine, home-feed merged w/ heart counts, heart toggle). /dates route added. Old StepOccasion/StepFont/StepWrite/StepCard/StepReview now unused (cleanup needs FIREFLY to delete). Verified end-to-end in Chrome vs local dev proxied to prod API (QN_PROXY_PROD=1 in vite.config). COMMITTED LOCALLY, NOT PUSHED — needs FIREFLY: db push (Status/Heart tables), deploy, build 7.

2026-10-09 — WEBSITE HOMEPAGE rebuilt from "QuteNote Website – Homepage · desktop.html" (a self-unpacking bundle export — real markup lives in the __bundler/template script island, images base64 in __bundler/manifest; extraction script pattern in scratchpad). Faithful JSX port into LandingPage.tsx: ink wordmark (public/site/logo-ink.png), hero postcard collage w/ lime IN 7 DAYS, steps, Why Be Qute, featured-artists polaroids, ultraviolet bleachers section, details/summary FAQ, rotated join postcard, burger mobile menu. 17 named artworks in public/site/. Judgment calls: artist placeholders filled with Luna Park/Doodle Co./Inkwell/QuteNote Studio (she should supply real names), step-04 truncated copy restored from her copy doc. Deployed + verified live.

## What I am working on right now
iOS app conversion (Emerald's priority as of Oct 6). Capacitor wrapper works in simulator. Remaining Phase 5 web items (CN Score, badges, connection birthdays) are parked until the iOS app ships.

## Next 3 things to do
1. Confirm beta review approval, send Emerald the public TestFlight link, have her test on her phone (especially Apple + Google sign-in, both unproven on a real device)
2. Collect Round 1 feedback (per round protocol: collect ALL feedback before starting fixes)
3. Later rounds: bump CURRENT_PROJECT_VERSION in ios/App/App.xcodeproj for EVERY new upload; then remaining Phase 5 web features (CN Score, badges, connection birthdays)

## QuteNote iOS facts
- App Store Connect App ID 6819877820, bundle club.cutenote.app, SKU qutenote-001
- Profile "QuteNote AppStore" (uuid 13ea71be-...) installed in ~/Library/MobileDevice/Provisioning Profiles and Xcode UserData
- Upload pipeline: VITE_API_BASE=https://qutenote.com/api npm run build -w apps/web → npx cap sync ios → xcodebuild archive CODE_SIGNING_ALLOWED=NO → xcodebuild -exportArchive with exportOptions (manual signing, destination upload) + ASC auth key flags
- ASC helper + exportOptions.plist + watcher live in session scratchpad — copy asc.js/exportOptions.plist into a project scripts/ios/ folder if needed long-term

## iOS build facts
- Native project: apps/web/ios (Capacitor, SPM not CocoaPods)
- Native build = `VITE_API_BASE=https://qutenote.com/api npm run build -w apps/web` then `npx cap sync ios` from apps/web
- Simulator check: xcodebuild -project ios/App/App.xcodeproj -scheme App -sdk iphonesimulator CODE_SIGNING_ALLOWED=NO build
- Apple credentials from Dreambound are reusable: ASC API key Y5NXGFNCFV (~/.appstoreconnect/private_keys/), issuer a8f9ba85-917d-49e9-888e-e128d4ef6822, Team 97276PB95S, cert "Apple Distribution: Emam Cohen" in login keychain. Key cannot do cloud signing — QuteNote needs its own provisioning profile made via ASC API (same pattern as "Dreambound AppStore" profile)
- Postcards are physical goods, so Apple guideline 3.1.3(e) lets Stripe checkout stay (no Apple IAP cut)

## Things I learned the hard way
- DO App Platform must build from the REPO ROOT (not apps/api source_dir). Packages are hoisted to /workspace/node_modules — if you build from apps/api only, dotenv and other deps can't be found at runtime.
- Prisma generate MUST run before tsc or the client won't initialize at runtime.
- TypeScript strict mode requires `import type { Foo }` for type-only imports.
- DO prunes devDependencies at runtime. Always compile to JS (tsc → dist/) and run `node dist/index.js`, never tsx in production.
- tsx watch is for local dev only. Never used in production.
- Kill existing processes before starting locally: `lsof -ti:4000 | xargs kill -9`
- Auth endpoints (register/login/me) each have their own `select` — update all three when adding user fields
- Stripe Invoice type doesn't expose .charge — cast via `any` with fallback
- ~/Documents is synced by iCloud with "optimize storage" — after months idle it evicts big files (node_modules) and commands fail with ETIMEDOUT reads. Fix: `brctl download <folder>` and wait. Consider pinning the project folder "always keep downloaded"
- First app launch in a fresh simulator can show a white screen for several seconds — relaunch/wait before assuming a crash
- Renaming the project folder gives Xcode a NEW DerivedData path — always resolve the freshest App.app with `ls -dt ~/Library/Developer/Xcode/DerivedData/App-*/.../App.app | head -1` or the simulator installs stale builds
- Xcode may skip recopying the Capacitor public folder on incremental builds — if web changes don't show in simulator, delete the built App.app and rebuild

## Files changed in most recent session (2026-04-20)
- apps/web/src/pages/LandingPage.tsx (new — full landing page)
- apps/web/src/pages/HomePage.tsx (extra card price $2→$3)
- apps/web/src/App.tsx (added LandingPage import + route)
- apps/api/src/index.ts (CuteNote → QuteNote)
- apps/api/package.json (@cutenote → @qutenote)
- package.json (cutenote → qutenote)
- prd.json (CuteNote → QuteNote)
- prd.json (phase-4 passes: true)
